Welcome to the **PC Assembly AR Game**, an interactive Unity3D experience where users can learn to assemble a personal computer in augmented reality (AR). This project is built with Unity3D and designed to run on AR-supported devices, allowing users to learn and interact with PC components in an immersive environment.

## Features

- **Realistic 3D Models**: High-quality models of PC components like CPUs, GPUs, RAM, motherboards, and more.
- **AR Interaction**: Engage with components in an AR space to simulate a hands-on PC assembly experience.
- **Educational Tool**: Learn the functions of each component and the correct order of assembly.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with basic components and move on to complex assembly tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Unity3D** (version 2022.3.40f1)
- **AR Foundation** package from Unity Package Manager
- **Supported AR Device** (ARCore-supported Android device - Android 7.0 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nasal-thanseer/reviveLAB.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Install the necessary AR Foundation packages through Unity Package Manager.
4. Build and run on your AR-supported device.

## How to Play

1. Open the app and allow camera permissions.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to place virtual PC components on a flat surface.
3. Assemble the PC by selecting components and positioning them correctly.
4. Receive feedback on your assembly accuracy and learn as you go.

## Future Enhancements

- **More Components**: Expanding the component library with additional parts.
- **Guided Assembly Mode**: Step-by-step instructions for beginners.
- **Compatibility Checks**: Warnings for incompatible component placements.
